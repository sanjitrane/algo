have three properties, 'data', 'prev' and 'next'.  Accept these as arguments to the 'Node' constructor, then
assign them to the instance as properties 'data', 'prev' and 'next'.
If 'next' is not provided to the constructor, then default its
value to be 'null'.
If 'prev' is not provided to the constructor, then default its value to be 'null'.
